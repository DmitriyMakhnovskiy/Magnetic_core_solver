Within this educational project, we delve into the calculation methodologies for magnetic cores in coils and transformers, employing the classical framework
rooted in principles of reluctance, magnetic flux, induction, magnetomotive force (MMF), and inductance. This classical model, by design, operates under the assumption
of constant magnetic permeability throughout the entirety of the magnetizing field, thus simplifying analysis. Notably, it does not account for hysteresis effects.

This simplified approach serves as an excellent entry point for students, providing a foundational understanding of magnetic core behaviour without overwhelming complexities.
Nonetheless, it's imperative to acknowledge the limitations inherent in this model. Specifically, the absence of hysteresis consideration and the assumption of linear permeability overlook real-world nuances. Introducing students to these simplified models while elucidating their constraints paves the way for a more comprehensive grasp of magnetic phenomena. Such an approach cultivates a solid foundation for future exploration into advanced studies or practical applications where accounting for hysteresis and nonlinearity becomes indispensable.
